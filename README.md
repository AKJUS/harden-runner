# Policy-based Runtime Security for GitHubÂ Actions

First-of-its-kind patent-pending technology that automatically correlates outbound traffic with each step of a workflow.

1. Add this code to your GitHub Actions workflow file as the first step. 

```
steps:
  - uses: step-security/harden-runner@v1
      with:
        egress-policy: audit
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

2. In the workflow logs, you will see a link to security insights and recommendations.

</p>

4. Add the recommended outbound endpoints to your workflow file, and only traffic to these endpoints will be allowed.

```
steps:
      - uses: step-security/harden-runner@v1
        with:
          allowed-endpoints:
            github.com:443
            nodejs.org:443
            registry.npmjs.org:443
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
```
