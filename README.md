# Harden-Runner: Security agent for GitHub-hosted runner

Harden-Runner GitHub Action installs a security agent on the GitHub-hosted runner to monitor the build process, prevent exfiltration of credentials, and detect compromised dependencies.

## Why

Hijacked dependencies and compromised build tools typically make outbound requests during the build process to exfiltrate data or credentials. There is also a risk that a compromised dependency or build tool may modify source code, dependencies, or artifacts.

Harden-Runner automatically correlates outbound traffic, file modifications, and process activity with each step of a workflow. You can also set a policy to restrict outbound traffic.

Check out the [hands-on tutorials](https://github.com/step-security/supply-chain-goat) to learn how `harden-runner` would have prevented past software supply chain attacks.

## How

1. Add `step-security/harden-runner` to your GitHub Actions workflow file as the first step in each job. In the pre step, the GitHub Actions installs a daemon that monitors process, file, and network activity.

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - uses: step-security/harden-runner@bdb12b622a910dfdc99a31fdfe6f45a16bc287a4 # v1
       with:
         egress-policy: audit
   ```

2. In the workflow logs, you will see a link to security insights and recommendations.

</p>

3. Click on the link ([example link](https://app.stepsecurity.io/github/jauderho/dockerfiles/actions/runs/1736506434)). You will see a process monitor view of what activities happened as part of each step. This currently includes the programs that made outbound calls and did file writes to source code or dependencies.

</p>

4. Below the insights, you will see the recommended policy. Add the recommended outbound endpoints to your workflow file, and only traffic to these endpoints will be allowed.

When you use `egress-policy: block` mode, you can also set `disable-telemetry: true` to not send telemetry to the StepSecurity API.

## Support for private repositories

Install the [Harden Runner App](https://github.com/marketplace/harden-runner-app) if you want to use `harden-runner` for `Private` repositories. This App only needs `actions: read` permissions on your repositories. You can install it on selected repositories, or all repositories in your organization.

## Testimonials

> _I think this is a great idea and for the threat model of build-time, an immediate network egress request monitoring makes a lot of sense_ - [Liran Tal](https://stars.github.com/profiles/lirantal/), GitHub Star, and Author of Essential Node.js Security

> _Harden-Runner strikes an elegant balance between ease-of-use, maintainability, and mitigation that I intend to apply to all of my 300+ npm packages. I look forward to the toolâ€™s improvement over time_ - [Jordan Harband](https://github.com/ljharb), Open Source Maintainer

> _Harden runner from Step security is such a nice solution, it is another piece of the puzzle in helping treat the CI environment like production and solving supply chain security. I look forward to seeing it evolve._ - Cam Parry, Senior Site Reliability Engineer, Kapiche
